How to run project:


Step 1: Setup Project Environment:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Install Flask and other required dependencies. 
You can do this using pip:
command used:
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Celery pika



Step 2: Configure RabbitMQ:
Install RabbitMQ on your system if you haven't already.
Start the RabbitMQ server.


Step 3: Define Flask App and Celery Worker:
Create a celeryconfig.py file to configure Celery. 
This file should contain settings like broker URL, result backend, etc.
Create your Flask application in app.py. Define your SQLAlchemy models and API routes here.
Define your Celery tasks in a separate tasks.py file.


Step 4: Start Celery Worker:
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
Start the Celery worker by running the following command:
celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info


Step 5: Run Flask App:
Open another terminal window/tab and navigate to your project directory.
Run your Flask application using the following command:
python app.py


Step 6: Test API Endpoints
Use a tool like Postman to send requests to your Flask API endpoints (/api/items).


Verify that the requests are processed correctly and that the Celery tasks are executed as expected.
